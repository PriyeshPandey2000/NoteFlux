# Real-Time Voice Processing with Intelligent Transcript Correction - PRD

## **Overview**
Enhance the existing voice-to-text system to provide real-time intelligent transcript correction using Grok AI. The system will process voice transcripts in chunks and apply contextual corrections, error fixes, and natural language understanding to produce clean, accurate transcripts as users speak.

## **Current State**
- ✅ Voice recording with WebSpeech API and Deepgram Nova 2
- ✅ Basic transcription display in homepage
- ✅ Transcript saving and editing functionality
- ✅ Voice commands in editor route

## **Problem Statement**
Current transcription has issues:
- Speech-to-text errors and typos
- No understanding of corrections ("500 GPUs sorry 100 GPUs")
- Grammar and formatting issues
- No real-time improvement of transcript quality

## **Solution**
Implement real-time intelligent transcript processing that:
1. Processes transcript chunks with Grok AI
2. Understands context and corrections
3. Fixes errors and improves formatting
4. Updates transcript in real-time with minimal latency

## **Core Features**

### **1. Intelligent Transcript Processor**
- **Real-time Processing**: Process transcript chunks as they arrive
- **Context Understanding**: Understand corrections and modifications
- **Error Correction**: Fix speech-to-text errors, grammar, punctuation
- **Format Improvement**: Proper capitalization, spacing, structure

### **2. Correction Examples**
| Speech Input | AI Corrected Output |
|--------------|-------------------|
| "in meeting we dccided to buy 500 gpus sorry 100 gpus" | "In the meeting, we decided to buy 100 GPUs" |
| "the revenue was 2 million no wait 3 million dollars" | "The revenue was 3 million dollars" |
| "send email to john at gmail dot com" | "Send email to john@gmail.com" |
| "schedule meeting for tommorow at 3 PM" | "Schedule meeting for tomorrow at 3 PM" |
| "we need to hire 5 engineers actually make that 7" | "We need to hire 7 engineers" |
| "lets discuss the q4 results comma they look good" | "Let's discuss the Q4 results, they look good" |

### **3. Real-time UI Updates**
- **Live Corrections**: Show corrections happening in real-time
- **Processing Indicators**: Visual feedback for AI processing
- **Confidence Levels**: Show confidence in corrections
- **Correction Highlights**: Highlight what was changed

## **Technical Implementation**

### **Phase 1: Core Processing Engine (45 min)**
```typescript
// lib/services/intelligent-transcript-processor.ts
class IntelligentTranscriptProcessor {
  - processChunk(chunk: string, context: string[]): Promise<string>
  - correctTranscript(text: string): Promise<string>
  - mergeCorrections(original: string, corrected: string): TranscriptDiff
}
```

### **Phase 2: Grok AI Integration (30 min)**
```typescript
// lib/services/grok-service.ts
class GrokService {
  - correctTranscript(text: string, context: string): Promise<string>
  - processWithPrompt(transcript: string): Promise<CorrectionResult>
}
```

### **Phase 3: Real-time Manager (45 min)**
```typescript
// lib/services/realtime-transcript-manager.ts
class RealtimeTranscriptManager {
  - addChunk(chunk: string): void
  - processQueue(): Promise<void>
  - getProcessedTranscript(): string
  - onTranscriptUpdate(callback: Function): void
}
```

### **Phase 4: UI Integration (60 min)**
- Update `VoiceChat` component for real-time processing
- Add correction indicators and processing states
- Implement smooth transcript updates
- Add error handling and fallback

## **AI Prompt Strategy**

### **Core Prompt Template**
```
You are an intelligent transcript processor. Your job is to:

1. Fix speech-to-text errors and typos
2. Understand corrections (e.g., "500 sorry 100" → "100")
3. Improve grammar and punctuation
4. Format properly (capitalization, spacing)
5. Understand context from previous chunks

Context from previous chunks: {context}
Current transcript chunk: {chunk}

Rules:
- If user corrects themselves ("X sorry Y"), use Y and remove X
- Fix obvious speech-to-text errors
- Maintain the user's intended meaning
- Keep it concise and natural
- Format emails, numbers, dates properly

Return only the corrected text, no explanations.
```

## **Performance Requirements**
- **Latency**: < 500ms processing time per chunk
- **Accuracy**: > 95% correction accuracy
- **Reliability**: Handle network failures gracefully
- **Scalability**: Support continuous processing without memory leaks

## **User Experience**

### **Before (Current)**
1. User speaks → Raw transcript appears
2. Errors and typos remain
3. No understanding of corrections
4. Manual editing required

### **After (Enhanced)**
1. User speaks → Raw transcript appears
2. AI processes in background (< 500ms)
3. Corrected transcript replaces raw version
4. Visual indicators show processing
5. Clean, accurate transcript ready to save

## **Success Metrics**
- **Correction Accuracy**: 95%+ of corrections are helpful
- **Processing Speed**: < 500ms average processing time
- **User Satisfaction**: Reduced manual editing by 80%
- **Error Reduction**: 90% fewer transcript errors

                                      ↓
                              Clean Transcript
```

## **Risk Mitigation**
- **API Failures**: Fallback to raw transcript
- **High Latency**: Queue management and timeout handling
- **Cost Control**: Rate limiting and chunk size optimization
- **Accuracy Issues**: Confidence scoring and user override options

## **Future Enhancements**
- Custom correction rules per user
- Domain-specific vocabulary (medical, legal, tech)
- Multi-language support
- Voice command integration
- Transcript summarization
